- Only /csfr form.php will be able to access the login feature in /csfr action.php.
Since this is the page where the "confirmation" Session variable is created. Basically trying to enter in /csfr action.php is no longer working.

- Both choices will function with the /csfr.php login feature.
From the /csfr.php page, we can enter the login and password directly, or we can navigate to the /csfr.html page, which will transfer the inputs to the /csfr.php page automatically.

furthermore, we can outline any observations that we can make while testing the CSRF rom. We might want to test for the following:

1. Submitting the form with valid credentials and the correct confirmation value.

2. Submitting the form with invalid credentials and the correct confirmation value.

3. Submitting the form with valid credentials and an incorrect confirmation value.

4. Submitting the form with invalid credentials and an incorrect confirmation value.

5. Attempting to submit the form using a CSRF attack (e.g., by creating a fake form on another website that submits to the "csfr_action.php" page with an incorrect confirmation value).

We should observe that the CSRF attack fails because the "csfr_action.php" script checks that the session variable and POST value for the confirmation value are equal. If they are not equal, the CSRF validation fails and the script outputs a "CSRF validation failed!" message.
