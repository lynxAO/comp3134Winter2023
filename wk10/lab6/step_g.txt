To mitigate the issue of comments being visible in the source code,
 we can convert all HTML comments to PHP comments using the syntax 
 /* comment */. This will ensure that the comments are not visible in the source code.


 <?php
echo "<h1>This is an example of an H1 header tag</h1>";
/* Created by Mohamed Abdiwahab Hussein with employee id: 101308661 */

echo "<h2>This is an example of an H2 header tag</h2>";
/* Created by Mohamed Abdiwahab Hussein with employee id: 101308661 */

echo "<h3>This is an example of an H3 header tag</h3>";
/* Created by Mohamed Abdiwahab Hussein with employee id: 101308661 */

echo "<h4>This is an example of an H4 header tag</h4>";
/* Created by Mohamed Abdiwahab Hussein with employee id: 101308661 */

echo "<h5>This is an example of an H5 header tag</h5>";
/* Created by Mohamed Abdiwahab Hussein with employee id: 101308661 */

echo "<h6>This is an example of an H6 header tag</h6>";
/* Created by Mohamed Abdiwahab Hussein with employee id: 101308661 */
?>
