strip_tags and html_entities are both functions in PHP that can be used to sanitize user input.

strip_tags is used to remove HTML tags from a string.
 This function removes all HTML tags from a string,
  which makes it useful for preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. However, 
  it does not encode special characters, which means that it does not prevent attacks like SQL injection.

html_entities is used to convert special characters in a string to their corresponding HTML entities.
 This function replaces special characters like <, >, and & with their corresponding HTML entities, 
 which makes it useful for preventing XSS attacks and other types of attacks that rely on special
  characters. However, it does not remove HTML tags, 
  which means that it does not prevent attacks like script injection.

In general, it is recommended to use both strip_tags and html_entities to sanitize user input. 
By using both functions, you can prevent both XSS attacks and other types of attacks that rely
 on special characters.
